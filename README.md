# Mod Support for JokerDisplay

DISCONTINUED

This adds extra mod support for the Balatro mod [JokerDisplay](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/).
It's preferable that mod devs add their own support in their mods, this repo is meant to be a temporary home for support added by me or a permanent one for mods that don't get any updates.

## Installation

1. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) (version >1.0.0)
2. Install [JokerDisplay](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplay/).
3. Clone/[Download](https://github.com/nh6574/JokerDisplayModSupport/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository.
4. Place the files in a folder in your Balatro mods folder (%appdata%\Balatro\Mods)
